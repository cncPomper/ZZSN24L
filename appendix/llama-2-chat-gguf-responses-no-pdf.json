        "Response": " A look at the philosophical debate.\nPhilosophers have been raising issues similar to those raised by digital theorists for centuries, but it is only recently that they have begun considering digital theory from their perspective as philosophers of science and technology. The idea that we may be living in a computer simulation has gained increasing attention in recent years. It has captured both scientist and the popular imagination due its bold claims about the nature of reality and the possibilities for the future.\nIn this course, we will examine some of the main arguments made by philosophers of science and technology regarding digital theory. We will consider whether it is possible to live in a computer simulation and what implications that has for our conceptions of identity and causality. In doing so, we will gain an appreciation for how philosophical questions about the nature of reality are being addressed by scientists working on digital theory.\nThe course will be taught through lectures, followed up by individual projects as part-way point throughout term. The course is open to all students with a keen interest in philosophy and science. No prior knowledge of either discipline or mathematics will be necessary; though basic concepts from both fields will be introduced.\nPhilosophy and Digital Theory\nDigital theory has been"

        "Response": "\nThe mind, the brain and consciousness.\nAwareness, attention, consciousness and cognition are all different aspects of our mental life. Awareness is a function or ability of our brain, which allows us to be aware of what we are experiencing; but how can something that we know to exist in our mind (consciousness) be a property of the brain?\nThe problem with this question is that it assumes that all experiences come from sensory perception and our interaction with the external world. This is not true, as there are many other types of experience, including internal thoughts, memories, imaginings and feelings. These are all aspects of consciousness that arise from within ourselves without being directly stimulated by any outside input.\nAwareness and attention can be thought of as two different ways in which we focus our minds on things: when you look at something, it captures your full attention; whereas awareness means only that something exists but doesn't demand total focus. You could say that awareness is like being aware of a sound without actually listening to it - it just knows there is something happening around us even though we don't know what it is specifically.\nThis idea leads into the"

When they come into conflict in adults who have grown older, then this too is also likely to create troubles.

For instance, consider the way a cat perceives the world. In its eyes, there is no distinction between what we call physical objects (i.e., solid things) and other forms of energy. A tree, for example, is not just an object that has mass but also one that has color, texture, and smell. For this reason, the cat perceives all things as having a consciousness.\nThe same can be said about humans who perceive everything they experience as if it were part of their own body.

        "Response": " How can we understand what we are, how our universe came to be, and why there\u2019s something rather than nothing at all? In this fascinating and mind-bending journey, cosmologist Sean Carroll seeks to uncover what quantum physics, consciousness, neuroscience, and the history of civilization can tell us about the true nature of reality. This is a thrilling exploration into how our world works, where we came from, and what lies beyond our universe.\nCarroll begins with the basics: what do we mean by \u201cbig questions\u201d? What do science and religion have to say on these topics? He then delves into cosmology\u2014the study of space, time, and gravity. Drawing upon scientific results like those that describe how a universe emerges from nothing and physicists\u2019 ideas about what dark matter is made of, Carroll takes us on an enlightening journey through the mysteries of existence.\nThe Big Picture by Sean M. Carroll is published in 2016 by Dutton Penguin Group. It has 324 pages and it's available to purchase now at Amazon for \u00a37.99 (plus shipping costs)."

        "Response": " This question is not as simple as it seems.\nThe concept of \"emotions\" and its scientific basis was largely invented in the second half of the twentieth century (Panksepp 2001, DeWall et al. 2008). The term \"feelings\" is more ancient but also rather ambiguous and sometimes contradictory in the modern sense.\nThe word \"emotion\" comes from Latin emovere (to move out), while \"feeling\" has a Greek origin with different senses that change through the history of literature and even dictionaries: to feel, to perceive, to be affected by some quality of external world and especially others people around, sometimes not being aware of it.\nThese concepts are closely related in modern psychology. There is also another notion used very frequently and usually understood as an emotional reaction or feeling, but that is actually quite different: mood (Hassin 2006). This is the sense with which \"emotion\" should be treated from here onwards.\nSo far we have defined two kinds of psychological phenomena: emotions and feelings.

He was sitting on a bench outside the main entrance to the New York Public Library, reading a book. It was a large, leather-bound volume with a gold title and an ornate picture of a lion on the cover. The book was open to a page that had been dog-eared by many readers before him, so he could read only in sections, which he did slowly, carefully, as if each word were precious.\nHe was a big man with thick white hair and a full beard. He wore a black overcoat and a knitted wool hat pulled low on his forehead to protect his ears from the cold.

In this talk, I will review the major ideas and approaches that have helped address these fundamental questions during more than five centuries since these inquiries were first posed.\nIn 1963, David Bohm, a physicist working at Princeton, offered one of his rare interventions to scientific proceedings with a paper entitled \u201cOn the Nature of Mind and Matter.\u201d In it he argued that the mind is not an epiphenomenon of matter but rather a \u201cmanifestation of an implicate order which permeates both matter and mind,\u201d as he put it. The following year, the psychologist Karl Pribram published his book Languages of the Brain (MIT Press). He developed what would come to be called \u201cholographic brain theory.\u201d It postulated that mental events arise from neural processes operating on two different scales\u2014on one level in our neurons and at a deeper level, holographically, in our brains. In 1974, the philosopher of science Wilfrid Sellars published his paper \u201cMental Events.\u201d He argued that"

The following post examines the most prominent arguments concerning the metaphysical necessity for a creation from an ultimate origin outside ourselves. There is nothing intrinsic within space, time, or matter (e.g., as depicted in Fig 1 below) that demands it all be eternal. This argumentation applies to all the basic forces and forms of nature.\nThe most popular and compelling answer to these questions has been proposed by William Lane Craig in his book The Kalam Cosmological Argument (2000). According to Craig, an all-powerful God must have brought into being a universe that is both contingent and dependent upon the existence of something other than itself. The most recent publication of this argument is in Craig\u2019s paper titled \u201cThe Existence of God\u201d in Philosophy Compass (2013).\nIn the following, I will briefly review some of the major points of the Kalam Cosmological Argument (KCA), then proceed to consider why there is nothing in cosmology or fundamental physics that supports a non-tempor"

But, what do we know about the nature of emotion in humans and how is this relevant to understanding emotions in other species?

This question has been asked by philosophers and scientists for centuries. The answer to the ultimate mind and cognitive related issues remain speculation although conscious perception has become a scientific topic since the 1980s, especially with the rise of modern neuroscience. In the past, there were no objective ways to investigate the human mind in real-time other than observing and questioning behavior and memory traces in animals. In this context, we are happy to introduce a new approach to understand the human brain that allows for noninvasive measurements of neural activity in humans.\nThe new method is based on the idea that one can infer what the mind does from its corresponding neuronal activities in the brain. The basic idea is to measure the activity of individual neurons in the human hippocampal and motor regions when patients mentally run their motorized footsteps forward. It seems very difficult if not impossible, based on common logic alone that neural signal representations or any processes directly predict behaviors unless humans\u2019 brains are somehow wired to do so."

This is an age-old question that has been asked by philosophers and scientists alike for centuries.\nSome people believe that human beings are inherently good and have a natural tendency to do what\u2019s right, while others believe that humans are born with an evil side and need to constantly struggle against their darker impulses.\nIn this article, we will explore both sides of the debate and provide you with evidence from researchers on either side. So whether you\u2019re team Good or Team Bad, read on for a fascinating look at one of the most controversial topics in existence today.\nThere are different theories as to what motivates people \u2013 one theory being that people are inherently good.

Improper syntax used when you think like a functional programmer will make your code look like an alien language.\n\u2013 interpreted vs compiled \u2013 this is another distinction that can often help or harm developers trying"

That's a question that has puzzled humans for thousands of years. The meaning of life, the universe and everything is 42. In this article we will look at some answers to this age-old question.\nIn this article, you can learn how different cultures, philosophers, writers, thinkers, religious and other experts define it. We'll also take a look at what the Bible says about life and its meaning.\nWhat is the meaning of life? The answer may vary depending on who you ask. For some people, the meaning of life is to live a happy and fulfilling existence. Others believe that the purpose of life is to make a positive impact on the world around them. Still others feel that their true calling in life is to follow God's will for their lives.\nWhatever your personal definition may be, there are certain things we can all agree on when it comes to what makes living so amazing. They include freedom to think for oneself without conforming (freedom"

How do you define reality? Is it just a collection of things that exist, or is it something more? What is your experience telling you about what we might mean when we use terms such as 'real world' and 'reality', whatever that really means.\nFor one, this notion can get philosophical fast in trying to give the scientific realities (molecules, particles) of things that are not physical reality. And that's before getting into discussions about whether reality is something that exists independently from us or if it is a construct of our minds and experiences.\nIt might be useful to first look at the more philosophical meanings that could relate to these kinds of discussions and get into this, what reality is or isn't, how we can define it and so on. We might want to ask whether reality is just an objective state of affairs out there in space-time, or if it is something more than that?\nThe nature of reality depends very much upon perspective"

It is the purpose of this paper to examine the question of what it means for one\u0092s actions to be purposeful (Sinnvoll), by way of three key philosophical ideas: 1) the distinction between action and its cause, 2) the distinction between causal and non-causal reasons, and 3) the distinction between a reason that is a motive for an action and"
